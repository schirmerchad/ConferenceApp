# Fullstack-project4
Project #4 for the Udacity FSND. An app and API created with Python and Google Cloud Endpoints.

This project uses Python and Google App Engine to develop a conference management app and API. Data management is provided using the Google Cloud Datastore and OAuth2 is used as the authentication framework. Google Cloud Endpoints provides the tools, libraries, and capabilities for the API backend.

<h1>Description</h1>
This app/API allows a logged in user to organize conferences and conference sessions. Conferences are stored in a database and can be queried and filtered as per the userâ€™s discretion. The app also has built in functionality to allow users to register for conferences and store upcoming conferences in a wish list.
